Pandas homework assignment

## Background
You've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
Use the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.

## Observations from Data
After completing the district summary, it was clear that the Charter schools had a higher passing rate for both math and reading compared to the district schools. 

What surprised me is that the District Schools spent more on each student than the Charter schools but this higher budget per student wasn't reflected as higher scores for math and reading. 

Unsurprisingly, was that larger schools had lower scores than smaller schools.  Oftentimes, larger schools equate to larger class sizes with higher teacher:student ratios.  This in turn means less time for individualized instruction.  Smaller schools usually means smaller teacher:student ratios that in turn means more individualized attention.
